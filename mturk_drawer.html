                In this study you will be playing an online game like pictionary but inverted.  <br>
                
                Instead of drawing a picture which others will guess,  <br>
                
                you will describe pictures others will draw and draw pictures others have described.  <br>
                
                This is the Draw Task: Draw an image descriped by another participant <br>
            
                <b>Note:</b><br>
                - DO NOT draw a picture of your own description <br>
                - DO NOT judge your own description or drawing <br>
                (In these cases refreshing the page will genrate a new task) <br>

                The study is expected to take 5 minutes <br>

                You will draw <b>5</b> images <br>

                Thanks for participating! <br>

                </p>

                The object is simple, you will be given a canvas to draw a picture based on a description. You will be evaluated on how accurately your picture matches the image that was being described. If you make a mistake, don't fret, clicking the <i>Clear</i> button will clear the canvas so you can try again. Lastly, most of these descriptions will be a list of attributes seperated by |||. In these cases simply draw the animal based on the list of features. Have fun and Good Luck!
